# Global-Commodity-Price-Index-Forecasting-2005-2026-
🌍 Global Commodity Price Index Forecasting (2005–2026)  This project involves time series forecasting of the Global Commodity Price Index using ARIMA and SARIMA models in Python. The workflow includes:

    - Data preprocessing and visualization.
    - Stationarity testing (ADF).
    - ACF/PACF analysis to determine ARIMA parameters.
    - Model training and evaluation (ARIMA & SARIMA).
    - Forecasting from May 2025 to December 2026.
    - Confidence interval plotting.
    - Evaluation using RMSE and MAPE.

📁 Tools used: pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels  
📈 Models: ARIMA(1,1,1), SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1,12)
📊 Output: Forecast values with confidence intervals plotted, and exported for further analysis.
